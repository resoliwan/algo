# Tree
### Height.
The number of edges between the root and the deepest leaf node.

# AVL tree
AVL tree and is named for its inventor: G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis.
### AVL Balance factor for a node.
Difference between the height of the left subtree and the right subtree.
- balanceFactor = height(leftSubTree) - height(rightSubTree)
- if balanceFactor > 0 then: 'left-heavy'.
- if balanceFactor `<` 0 then: 'right-heavy'.

### Tree in balanced
- if balanceFactor in {-1, 0, 1}
